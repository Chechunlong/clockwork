Instructions on how to create a clockwork simulation 
of a group of plcs and use it to test another clockwork
program.

Note: A simulation is already created in 


0. Setup

CWDIR=/opt/latproc/
PROJECT_ROOT=/Users/martin/projects/latproc/wooltech/plc2bps/tag

* build clockwork
* run make in the clockwork modbus directory to generate mbmon
* build the tools in the clockwork hmi directory

* copy the koyo.conf file to your working directory

NOTE: step 1 has already been done for the 3G35-8C26 program

1. Create a clockwork simulation program

1a - define a channel that includes all the plcs that are to be simulated

cat >/tmp/channels.lpc
PLC_CHANNEL CHANNEL {
	OPTION host "localhost";
	OPTION port 7701;
	MONITORS MACHINES LINKED TO CORE_MASTER;
	MONITORS MACHINES LINKED TO GRAB_MASTER;
	MONITORS MACHINES LINKED TO GRAB_CUTTER;
	PUBLISHER;
}


1b - run clockwork on the test program and add the above channel

"$CWDIR"/iod/cw \
"$CWDIR"/tests/stdchannels.cw \
"$CWDIR"/tests/modbus_master.cw \
"$PROJECT_ROOT"/3G35-8C26/config.lpc 
/tmp/channels.lpc

1c - generate the clockwork simulation

$CWDIR/modbus/build/mbmon -s /tmp/plc_sim.lpc

1d - review the generated files  /tmp/plc_sim.lpc and /tmp/plc_sim.lpc.modbus

1e - cleanup: kill the cw program started at 1b.

2. run the clockwork plc simulation

2a - clockwork

note: use a different port so that it does not interfere with the project file under test

cd /tmp
"$CWDIR"/iod/cw -m /tmp/plc_sim.lpc.modbus -cp 10001 \
    "$CWDIR"/tests/stdchannels.cw /tmp/plc_sim.lpc
    
2b. run modbusd

"$CWDIR"/iod/modbusd --cwout=10001

2c. - run the panel

"$CWDIR"/hmi/build/core_panel

3. run your test program

3a - clockwork 

"$CWDIR"/iod/cw ...

3b - modbus connector for each plc in your program

"$CWDIR"/modbus/build/mbmon --channel my_channel
